\noindent In the third network experiment, we measured the overhead of establishing a TCP connection. We did this by starting a server on the auxiliary machine described earlier, and repeatedly listening for clients, receiving a quick message, and terminating the connection. The measurement was on the time taken by the ``connect" function call in the client code to complete.
\\
\\
Again, we expect the remote connection to consistently take longer and more variable amounts of time than the loopback connection.

Our data for this experiment is more well behaved than the other experimental data in this section. The loopback connection setup time was 590000 $\pm$ 140000 cycles, and the two-machine data required 2200000 $\pm$ 910000 cycles. This matches our expectations.
