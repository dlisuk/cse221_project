\noindent In the third network experiment, we measured the overhead of establishing a TCP connection. We did this by starting a server on the machine described in the introduction to the network experiments, and repeatedly listening for clients, receiving a quick message, and terminating the connection. The measurement was on the time taken by the ``connect" function call in the client code to complete.
\\
\\
Again, we expect the remote connection to consistently take longer and more variable amounts of time than the loopback connection.

Our data for this experiment is more well behaved than the other experimental data in this section. The loopback connection setup time was 418784 $\frac{+}{-}$ 97890 cycles, and the two-machine data required 1590593 $\frac{+}{-}$ 649136 cycles.
