Next we wish to measure the avarege file system reading time in three access patterns (sequential, random block in an opened file, and random lookup in a freshly opened file).
We measure files from 512 bytes up to 250MB.
For each file size, we repeat each experiment ten times.

Sequential reading is done by opening a file and reading all blocks from start to finish.  We randomly sample 100 of the blocks and measure the time for the block to be read and report the mean/min/max.

Random reading is only measured for files with at least 16 file system blocks of 4096 bytes.
For an already open file we measure performance by opening the file, generating 100 random block numbers to seek to, seeking and reading.
We measure the time of the seek and the read since this is the operation which would be required for a random block read.
To measure performance of a freshly opened file, we also perform an experiment with the same process except we open/close the file within the measurement time.

We believe these three access patterns capture the main read only access patterns expected in most programs.
