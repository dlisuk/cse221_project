The first experiment measures the time take to take a measurement (whoa!).

Thus we implement this experiment function: 
\begin{verbatim}
unsigned long measure() {
  GET_HIGH(start);
  GET_HIGH(end);
  return end - start;
}
\end{verbatim}

This time difference proves to be 11 cycles. This is the result obtained from every single trial.
