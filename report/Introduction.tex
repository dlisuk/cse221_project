The goal of this project is to obtain a performance profile for a Raspberry Pi model B computer. At this second milestone, we have made significant progress in our timing code.  We've figured out how to access the instruction counter which was undone on last measure.  We thus have much better measurements than our previous milestone.  We've also added experiments covering the memory system.  We still are unable to get the kernel thread test fully working due to issues with compiling arbitrary kernel threads under the ARM linux distribution we are running.  We hope to resolve this issue soon.

Our team consists of Joshua Marxen and David Lisuk. Joshua revised the previous experiments and explored data analysis methods.  David implemented the current memory tests and worked on the timing code. Our compiler is gcc version 4.8.3, as implemented in the Raspbian linux operating system. We disabled any compiler optimizations by compiling with the -O0 flag.

On the report there was an error in communication so the final updates to the old experiments did not get placed on github.  Some sections may refer to old numbers.
